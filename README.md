# Klinkenberg-Effect-Slippage-Effect-
This project estimates the true liquid permeability (Kl) from measured gas permeability (Kg) using the Klinkenberg correction, a common technique in reservoir engineering to account for gas slippage. The program applies the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively solve for Kl and visualizes the correction curve using Matplotlib.
